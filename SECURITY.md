We ask you to include a detailed description of the vulnerability, a list of services involved (e.g. exim, dovecot) and the versions which you've tested, full steps to reproduce the vulnerability, and include your findings and expected results.

Please do not open any public issue on Github or any other social media before the report has been published and a fix has been released.

With that, good luck hacking us ;)
