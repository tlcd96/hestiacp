# Contributing to Hestiaâ€™s documentation

The documentation is built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org). There are a couple of requirements to contribute to it.

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher with [pnpm installed](https://pnpm.io/installation);
- A code editor with Vue and Markdown support. We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Viewing your changes locally

1. Open the project folder in your terminal.
2. If the dependencies are not installed yet, install them by running `pnpm i`.
3. Run `pnpm dev`.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
